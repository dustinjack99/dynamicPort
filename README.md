# Dynamic Port - Node.js Homework

Command line program that takes user data and dynamically creates a PDF Github portfolio.
<br>
<br>

## How it Runs

User starts by entering their github profile name, followed by their favorite color.
A user can't choose white as a color, because the text used in the portfolio is white.
A few async functions fire off - one that makes and API call to Github and one that
grabs the userdata entered.

Using the user and API data from Github, the JS generates an HTML template literal and
writes a new index.html file. Then using NPM Puppeteer, the index.html is thrown into 
the default browser, a screenshot is taken, then Puppeteer writes a PDF file in A4 format.
We have ourselves a portfolio!

<br>

Here's what it looks like. Using puppeteer, we're able to link a seperate .css stylesheet
in the HTML template literal. So we can still style in a CSS spreadsheet without building
a giant HTML template in our JS.

Now let's assume a user goes rogue and decides their favorite color is white. Austen enters
white as a color - will it generate a fully white portfolio?

Thankfully, there's an *if* function that looks for that. It will default the background
of the portfolio to lightblue - a very pleasant color for a professional portfolio.
